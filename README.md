# SpaceShooter
A Space Shooter simulation i did as a project for Advanced OPP Course


**Exercise Description**
This exercise involves a game simulation set in the "Star Wars" timeline, requiring the use of the Model-View-Controller paradigm. You are required to provide a solution using C++ and adhere to object-oriented design patterns under constraints.

**Simulation Details**
The simulation describes the operation of the Galactic Empire through the movement of crystals between stations and Fortress Stars, thwarted by space fleets identified with the rebels. The space is defined as a two-dimensional Euclidean space with a measure unit of 1000km. No enforcement of boundary conditions exists.

There are three types of agents in our simulation:

**Imperial Agent (Soldier)** 
- An object representing a soldier of any rank operating within the Galactic Empire.
**Commanders and Admirals**
- Always mobile, matching their rank with appropriate spacecraft.
**Space Stations**
- Each station has a production capacity for crystals (unlimited storage capacity) and is a simulation object with a fixed location and content that is initialized at the beginning of the simulation.
Simulation Mechanics

Spacecraft movements are defined by coordinates or a destination angle.
The simulation includes interactions between the movement of crystals, influenced by time, and attacks by rebel spacecraft.
Spacecraft used include Transport Shuttle, TIE Bomber, and Star Destroyer, each with specific operational roles and flight paths determined during the simulation.

**spaceShips**
**Star Destroyer**: A powerful spacecraft used by the Galactic Empire for large-scale battles and destruction, capable of long-range firing.

**TIE Bomber**: A spacecraft designed specifically for bombing missions, typically used to target enemy bases or large structures.

**Transport Shuttle**: A shuttle used for transporting goods, troops, or crystals between various locations within the Empire.

**Millennium Falcon**: known as a fast and agile spacecraft used by the rebels for smuggling and escape missions.

These spacecraft are integral to the simulation described, each serving specific roles within the Galactic Empire's logistical and combat strategies.
